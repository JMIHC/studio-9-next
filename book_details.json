His search for answers will take him from the quiet village where he grew up to the greatest cities of nineteenth-century Persia, and ultimately into the middle of a war that will tear apart families, challenge the country's most powerful leaders, and force Navid to question everything that he thought he knew. As the imperial army clashes with scholars and peasants in the ancient streets of Zanjan, Navid will participate in the birth of a new spiritual movement that has the power to transform the world.",
